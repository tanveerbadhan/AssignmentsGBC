            <p class="aboutText">The Incredible Hulk is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by
                Marvel Comics. Created
                by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The
                Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative
                identity
                disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter ego Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking, and
                muscular
                humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter ego Dr. Robert Bruce
                Banner,
                a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically
                resent
                each other.
